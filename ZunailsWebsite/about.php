However, if you opt for complex nail art, it can take significantly longer. Additionally, if you need removal services, please keep in mind that this will require extra time. When booking an appointment, consider your schedule and avoid choosing complex services if you are short on time</div>

                    <div class="answer">The longevity of your nails depends on several factors, including how fast your nails grow and how well you take care of them. Some of my clients have gone up to 7 weeks with their nails looking great. With proper aftercare, the nails don’t easily lift or chip. Regular maintenance appointments can also help keep your nails in the best possible condition.</div>

                    <button class="question">How damaging is artificial nails for my natural nails?<span class="arrow">&#9660;</span></button>
                    <div class="answer">Artificial nails can be damaging to your natural nails if not applied or handled properly. Mishandling or improper application can lead to issues such as thinning or weakening of the natural nail. However, with proper care and application, the risk of damage can be minimized. Regular use of cuticle oil helps keep your nails strong and healthy. At Zunails, we take great care to ensure that your nails are maintained properly to prevent any damage. We also recommend having your artificial nails removed by a professional to ensure the health and integrity of your natural nails.</div>

                    <button class="question">What aftercare tips do you recommend for maintaining my nails?<span class="arrow">&#9660;</span></button>
                    <div class="answer">Proper aftercare is essential to maintain the longevity and health of your nails. Regularly applying cuticle oil helps keep your nails and cuticles moisturized and strong. Avoid using your nails as tools for tasks like opening cans or scraping off labels to prevent chipping or breaking. When doing household chores, especially those involving water or harsh chemicals, wear gloves to protect your nails. Be gentle with your nails, avoiding excessive pressure or force. Keep your nails clean and dry to prevent lifting and fungal infections. Schedule regular maintenance appointments for fills and check-ups to maintain their health and appearance. Lastly, avoid biting your nails, as this can damage both artificial and natural nails. Following these aftercare tips will help ensure your nails stay beautiful and healthy for as long as possible.</div>

                    <div class="answer">If your nails chip shortly after your appointment, please come back for a quick fix as soon as you can. If it's clear that the chipping is due to an issue on my end, the repair will be free of charge. However, if the damage occurred because of something you did, a fee will apply for the repair.

                    <button class="question">What is the difference between Gel and Acrylic<span class="arrow">&#9660;</span></button>
                    <div class="answer">The main difference between gel and acrylic nails lies in their application, appearance, and durability. Gel nails, specifically the hard builder gel that I use, are applied in layers and cured under a UV or LED light. They tend to have a more natural and glossy finish and are generally more flexible than acrylic nails. Acrylic nails, on the other hand, are created by mixing a liquid monomer and a powder polymer to form a hard protective layer over your natural nails. They are known for their strength and durability but can appear thicker and less natural compared to gel nails. Both options can be customized with various shapes and designs, but the choice depends on your personal preference and lifestyle.</div>

                    <button class="question">What is the difference between Sculpture and Overlay?<span class="arrow">&#9660;</span></button>
                    <div class="answer">Sculpture involves extending the length of your natural nails using forms and gel or acrylic, ideal for those who want longer nails. Overlay applies a layer of gel or acrylic directly onto your natural nails without extending them, adding strength and durability.</div>
